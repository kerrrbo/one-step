  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:40px;"> HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and
    other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create
    structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
    and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
